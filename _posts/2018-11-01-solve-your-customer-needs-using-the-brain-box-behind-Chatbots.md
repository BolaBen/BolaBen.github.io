**What are Chatbots?**

Chatbots are increasingly transforming the way we interact with software. They provide a great business opportunity for both small
, medium and large companies.

Chatbots can be defined as software agents that converse through a chat interface.They’re software programs that are able to have a 
conversation,which provides some kind of value to the end user.They make the user feel understood and helped. They create 
a certain rapport with the user, without pretending to be human. they provides information to customers, and are quite useful for 
most businesses.

**Who are Chatbots for?**

historically, technology has long enabled smaller companies to provide great customer care that was once only available to companies 
with deep pockets.

Big companies might be able to afford to hire enough people to support a large volume of requests from customers. Smaller companies 
might not. A sudden influx of requests for support or information can overwhelm most businesses - especially smaller ones, which 
are usually less staffed. Longer waiting times, whether on the phone, in chat, or by email, also frustrate your customers with a host 
of negative consequences for your business.

And let’s face it, you might not be able to afford even a single person to be on standby simply to answer your visitors’ questions in
a “chat with us” box on your site. Wouldn’t it be nice to look professional by providing a live chat service like the big guys do, 
while actually cutting down on the amount of support you have to provide and at the same time augmenting your available resources.

**Values to business**	

A chatbot, for example, collect relevant information from prospective customers before you personally follow up with them.
Or it might provide assistance in answering the most common questions and requests for information.Bonus points for doing so 
immediately and on a 24/7 basis.

In other words, a chatbot can act as a filter to handle the most common scenarios. For example, a hotel might drastically cut down 
on the number of calls that its reception desk receives simply by having a chatbot that replies to the most common inquires, such
as restaurant hours or checkout times, perhaps setting an alarm call, or customers figuring out how to connect to the Wi-Fi.
This leaves the hotel staff with a greater degree of time and energy to tackle more elaborate requests, such as changing rooms 
because one of their customers found crickets in their room.

**Analyzing Chatbot Conversations for Insights**
We can get stats about our Chatbots usage uncovering insights through conversations daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and even year 
worth of data. We can also see how many back and forth between the user and chatbot took place, how long was the conversation, 
on what date and time it took place, and how many questions from users were detected. This information is gold, not just because 
it allows us to determine if our chatbot is actually being used by our visitors, but also because it enables us to build a better 
chatbot for a cool user experience.

In fact, we're able to see which business domain questions are most requested by our users and perhaps spend more time augmenting 
and refining them to make better business decisions.

A good chatbot should be able to handle most of the user interactions successfully, and when not, you can improve it.

Finally, chatbots are universally useful, regardless of whether you are a one-person operation or a fortune 500 company.
